### CT1: Handling Dictionary Data

In this critical thinking assignment, we are handling dictionary data in Python language. As a conventional dictionary maps words to definitions, a dictionary is an unordered collection that stores key-value pairs that map immutable keys to values. To illustrate, a dictionary associates values with the keys. Every key maps to a particular value. The purpose of this critical thinking is to write a program to provide a Dictionary object with the following tasks that will be applied in the discussion.
